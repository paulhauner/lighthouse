# Allow setting page size limits for jemalloc at build time:
# For certain architectures (like aarch64), we must compile
# jemalloc with support for large page sizes, otherwise the host's
# system page size will be used, which may not work on the target systems.
# JEMALLOC_SYS_WITH_LG_PAGE=16 tells jemalloc to support up to 64-KiB
# pages. See: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/5244
